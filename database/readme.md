### Database

Databases: A database is a structured repository or collection of data that is stored and retrieved electronically for use in applications. Data can be stored, updated, or deleted from a database.

Database Management System (DBMS): The software used to access the database by the user and application is the database management system. Check out these few links describing a DBMS in more detail.

### Data Modeling

An abstraction that organizes elementes of data and how they will relate to each other.

- Data Organization: The organization of the data for your applications is extremely important and makes everyone's life easier.
- Use cases: Having a well thought out and organized data model is critical to how that data can later be used. Queries that could have been straightforward and simple might become complicated queries if data modeling isn't well thought out.
- Starting early: Thinking and planning ahead will help you be successful. This is not something you want to leave until the last minute.
- Iterative Process: Data modeling is not a fixed process. It is iterative as new requirements and data are introduced. Having flexibility will help as new information becomes available.

### Intro to Relational Databases

This model organizes data into one or more tables of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Generaly, each table represents one 'entity type' (such as customer or product).

Is a digital database based on the relational model of data... a software system use to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system (RDBMS)

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language use across almost all relational database system for querying and maintaining the database.

Database/Schema is a collection of tables;
Tables/Relation is a group of rows sharing the same labeled elements.

Column/Attribute is a labeled element
Rows/Tuple is a single item.
